<h2>
    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? 
</h2>
   
Previous to taking this class I had a very basic understanding of html and javascript. This is my first experience with CSS. I have an understanding of basic functins and queries used in sql.

    <h2>
    Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
</h2> 


I used the tempate but modified much of the code. I used the example in the assignment decription but change a lot of things in css and added all the pages individually.

<h2>
        What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
    </h2>
  
  
    The artifact section caused the most trouble, not because it was challenging but it was mostly very tedious and not enjoyable. The remainder of the website project was creative.
