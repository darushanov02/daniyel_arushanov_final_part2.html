<h2>
    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? 
</h2>
    Previous to taking this class I had a very basic understanding of html and javascript. This is my first experience with CSS. 
<h2>
    Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
</h2> 

I used the tempate but modified much of the code.
    <h2>
        What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
    </h2>
   Artifact, not because it was challenging but it was mostly very tedious and not enjoyable. The remainder of the website project was creative.

    <h2>
        How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
    </h2>
    After taking this course my view of browswer and web pages has completly changed. It is much moore complicated that I could have imagined.
   <h2>
    What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
   </h2>

Yes, this course offers a lot of information about web developement although the rubric and assigment descriptions are very confusing.
